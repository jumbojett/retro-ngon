    <body>
        <!--Step 1. Create a HTML5 canvas element in your HTML source. This is where the rendered
            triangle will be displayed.-->
            
            <canvas id="render-canvas" class="ngon-canvas ngon-pixelated-upscale"></canvas>

        <!--Step 2. Add the canvas's CSS classes. You could put these in a separate CSS file, but
            for the sake of this demonstration, they're embedded in a <style> element.-->

            <style scoped>
                .ngon-canvas {
                    width: 300px;
                    height: 300px;
                    background-color: lightgray;
                }

                /* If the render scale is < 1, upscale with nearest-neighbor interpolation.*/
                .ngon-pixelated-upscale {
                    image-rendering: pixelated;
                    image-rendering: -moz-crisp-edges;
                    image-rendering: -webkit-crisp-edges;
                }
            </style>

        <!--Step 3. Include the renderer's JavaScript source files. Note that we're giving the
            path here as relative to the current directory, which we assume is one folder above
            where the renderer's source files are (e.g. "rngon/samples/", and the JavaScript is
            in "distributable/").-->

            <script src="../distributable/rngon.cat.js"></script>

        <!--Step 4. Create a triangle object. We'll assign the triangle a yellow color, and ask
            it to be drawn with a wireframe around it.-->

            <script>
                const triangle = Rngon.ngon([Rngon.vertex(-0.5, -0.5, 0),
                                             Rngon.vertex(0.5, -0.5, 0),
                                             Rngon.vertex(0.5, 0.5, 0)],
                                            {
                                                color: Rngon.color_rgba(255, 255, 0),
                                                texture: null,
                                                hasSolidFill: true,
                                                hasWireframe: true,
                                            });
            </script>

        <!--Step 5. Render the triangle onto the canvas. Note that we first construct a mesh that
            acts as a container for the triangle, then pass the mesh to the renderer as the sole entry
            in an array of meshes. We request the render scale to be 1, which causes the rendering
            to span all of the canvas's pixels. If we asked for a scale less than 1, the image would
            be rendered at a resolution of width * scale and height * scale, then upscaled to the
            dimensions of the canvas. The outcome of this would be a more pixelated look, and also
            slightly better performance.-->

            <script>
                Rngon.render("render-canvas", [Rngon.mesh([triangle])],
                             {
                                 cameraPosition: Rngon.translation_vector(0, 0, 3), /*camera position*/
                                 cameraDirection: Rngon.rotation_vector(0, 0, 0), /*camera direction; values in degrees 0-359*/
                                 scale: 1, /*scale of the rendered image, relative to the size of the canvas*/
                             });
            </script>

        <!--Step 6. That's it. When you load the page, you should see a 300 x 300 light gray box
            with a yellow triangle inside it.-->

        <!--Step 7. For added effect, let's make the triangle rotate.-->

            <script>
                // A function that returns a mesh containing the triangle rotated by a certain amount
                // each successive frame.
                const rotatingTriangle = (frameCount)=>
                {
                    const rotationSpeed = 1;
                    return Rngon.mesh([triangle],
                                      {
                                          rotation: Rngon.rotation_vector(0, (frameCount * rotationSpeed), 0)
                                      });
                };

                // A function that executes repeatedly, at the device's refresh rate. On each execution,
                // the function re-renders the triangle in its new orientation, given the accumulating
                // frame count.
                (function render_loop(frameCount = 0)
                {
                    Rngon.render("render-canvas", [rotatingTriangle(frameCount)],
                                 {
                                     cameraPosition: Rngon.translation_vector(0, 0, 3),
                                 });

                    window.requestAnimationFrame(()=>render_loop(frameCount + 1));
                })();
            </script>
